# US Accidents Analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset containing details of accidents that occurred in the United States. The dataset contains 46 features that describe different aspects of the accidents, such as location, weather conditions, and infrastructure. The goal of the analysis is to gain insights into the factors that contribute to accidents and to identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains 30 lakh observations and 46 variables. The variables include information such as the severity of the accident, the time and location of the accident, weather conditions, and infrastructure. Some notable features of the data include:

- The "Severity" variable, which ranges from 1 to 4, indicating the severity of the accident.
- The "Start_Time" and "End_Time" variables, which contain the timestamps of when the accident occurred and when it ended, respectively.
- The "Start_Lat" and "Start_Lng" variables, which contain the latitude and longitude of the starting point of the accident, respectively.
- The "Distance(mi)" variable, which contains the distance (in miles) between the starting point and ending point of the accident.
- The "Weather_Condition" variable, which contains a description of the weather conditions at the time of the accident.
## Analysis
The analysis was performed using libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The code was written in google colab and pushed to git for version control. Some of the insights from the analysis include:

- The number of accidents per city decreases exponentially.
- Less than 5% of cities have more than 1000 yearly accidents.
- Over 1200 cities have reported just one accident, which may need further investigation.
The above insights are obtained from the data cleaning, data preparation, visualization and exploratory data analysis.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project aimed to analyze a dataset of accidents in the United States to gain insights into the factors that contribute to accidents and to identify patterns and trends in the data. The analysis revealed some interesting insights about the number of accidents per city and the factors that may contribute to accidents. More detailed analysis can be done by analyzing the data on a deeper level to uncover any other insights or patterns that may be present in the data.
